# noncommutativity-ordereffects

This repository contains the code necessary to replicate experiments from the arXiv work, "An inductive bias from quantum mechanics: learning
order effects with non-commuting measurements". There are three scripts: 

1. make_data: contains function generators for artificial datasets D1 and D2 unitilized in the work.
2. non-commute_main: contains the main script for obtaining the non-commutativity results when training on datasets with various order effect strengths. 
3. generalization_main: contains the main script for obtaining the training and test results for evaluating generalization.
